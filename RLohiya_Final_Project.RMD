```{r}

#download the files and then load them from storage
F1 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Riteshlohiya/Data605_Final_Project/master/F1.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
F1

#define X and Y.  
X <- F1$X1
Y <- F1$Y1
```


#Probability.

Calculate as a minimum the below probabilities a through c. Assume the small letter "x" is estimated as the 1st quartile of the X variable, and the small letter "y" is estimated as the 2d quartile of the Y variable. Interpret the meaning of all probabilities.

```{r}
# get quartiles
summary(X)
```

```{r}
x <- summary(X)[2]
x
```


```{r}
summary(Y)
y <- summary(Y)[3]
y
```
